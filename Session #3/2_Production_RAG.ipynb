Use the prisoners and convicts!”  \\n“But there aren’t\\xa0enough,\\xa0Señor\\xa0Simoun!”  \\n“Then, if there aren’t enough, let all the villagers, the old men, the youths, the boys, work. Instead of the fifteen days \\nof obligatory service, let them work three, four, five months for the State, with the additional obligation that each one \\nprovide his own food and tools.”  \\nThe startled Don Custodio turned his head to see if there was any Indian within ear-shot, but fortunately those \\nnearby were rustics, and the two helmsmen seemed to be very much occupied with the windings of the river.  \\n“But,\\xa0Señor\\xa0Simoun—”  \\n“Don’t fool yourself, Don Custodio,”\\xa0continued Simoun dryly, “only in this way are great enterprises carried out \\nwith small means. Thus were constructed the Pyramids, Lake Moeris, and the Colosseum in Rome. Entire provinces \\ncame in from the desert, bringing their tubers to feed on. Old men, youths, and boys labored in transporting stones, \\nhewing them, and carrying them on their shoulders under the direction of the official lash, and afterwards, the \\nsurvivors returned to their homes or perished in the sands of the desert. Then came other provinces, then others, \\nsucceeding one another in the work during years. Thus the task was finished, and now we admire them, we travel, \\nwe go to Egypt and to Home, we extol the Pharaohs and the Antonines. Don’t fool yourself—the dead remain \\ndead, and might only is considered right by posterity.”  \\n“But,\\xa0Señor\\xa0Simoun,\\xa0such\\xa0measures\\xa0might\\xa0provoke\\xa0uprisings,”\\xa0objected Don Custodio, rather uneasy over the turn \\nthe affair had taken.  \\n“Uprisings, ha, ha! Did the Egyptian people ever rebel, I wonder? Did the Jewish prisoners rebel against the pious \\nTitus? Man, I thought you were better informed in history!”  \\nClearly Simoun was either very presumptuous or disregarded conventionalities! To say to Don Custodio’s face that \\nhe did not know history! It was enough to make any one lose his temper! So it seemed, for Don Custodio forgot \\nhimself and retorted, “But the fact is that you’re not among Egyptians or Jews!”  \\n“And these people have rebelled more than once,”\\xa0added the Dominican, somewhat timidly. “In the times when they \\nwere forced to transport heavy timbers for the construction of ships, if it hadn’t been for the clerics—”  \\n“Those times are far away,”\\xa0answered Simoun, with a laugh even drier than usual. “These islands will never again \\nrebel, no matter how much work and taxes they have. Haven’t you lauded to me, Padre Salvi,”\\xa0he added, turning to \\nthe Franciscan, “the\\xa0house\\xa0and\\xa0hospital\\xa0at\\xa0Los\\xa0Baños,\\xa0where\\xa0his\\xa0Excellency\\xa0is\\xa0at\\xa0present?”  \\nPadre Salvi gave a nod and looked up, evading the question.  \\n“Well, didn’t you tell me that both buildings were constructed by forcing the people to work on them under the whip \\nof a lay-brother? Perhaps that wonderful bridge was built in the same way. Now tell me, did these people rebel?”  \\n“The fact is—they have rebelled before,”\\xa0replied the Dominican, “and ab actu ad posse valet illatio!”  \\n“No, no, nothing of the kind,”\\xa0continued Simoun, starting down a hatchway to the cabin. “What’s said, is said! And \\nyou, Padre Sibyla, don’t talk either Latin or nonsense. What are you friars good for if the people can rebel?”  \\nTaking no notice of the replies and protests, Simoun descended the small companionway that led below, repeating \\ndisdainfully, “Bosh, bosh!”  \\nPadre Sibyla turned pale; this was the first time that he, Vice-Rector of the University, had ever been credited with \\nnonsense. Don Custodio turned green; at no meeting in which he had ever found himself had he encountered such an \\nadversary.  \\n“An American mulatto!”\\xa0he fumed.  \\n“A British Indian,”\\xa0observed Ben-Zayb in a low tone.  \\n“An American, I tell you, and shouldn’t I know?”\\xa0retorted Don Custodio in ill-humor. “His Excellency has told me \\nso. He’s a jeweler whom the latter knew in Havana, and, as I suspect, the one who got him advancement by lending \\nhim money. So to repay him he has had him come here to let him have a chance and increase his fortune by selling \\ndiamonds—imitations, who knows? And he so ungrateful, that, after getting money from the Indians, he wishes—\\nhuh!”\\xa0The sentence was concluded by a significant wave of the hand.  \\nNo one dared to join in this diatribe. Don Custodio could discredit himself with his Excellency, if he wished, but \\nneither Ben-Zayb, nor Padre Irene, nor Padre Salvi, nor the offended Padre Sibyla had any confidence in the \\ndiscretion of the others.  \\n“The fact is that this man, being an American, thinks no doubt that we are dealing with the redskins. To talk of these \\nmatters on a steamer! Compel, force the people! And he’s the very person who advised the expedition to the \\n[9]\\n[10]\\n[11]'"

Capitan Tiago is known for his hospitable nature and is considered one of the richest landlords in Binondo, as well as a planter of some importance due to his estates in Pampanga.

In the generation component, it employs ChatOpenAI with the gpt-4o-mini model, processing the retrieved context through a ChatPromptTemplate. Finally, the output is delivered via StrOutputParser.
